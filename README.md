### Project Overview

Data analysis is crucial for understanding sales performance and identifying areas for improvement. This project aims to analyze XYZ pharmaceutical sales data to uncover key trends, patterns and insights. Since it was my first experience working with sales data, this project helped me get an understanding of sales analytics, from identifying the crucial KPIs to offering insightful analysis and actionable recommendations. Additionally, I was able to improve my proficiency with Microsoft Excel tools.

### Objectives

The main objectives are to analyze sales and commission data for XYZ Pharmaceuticals, identify the key trends and patterns in sales performance, compare sales and commission performance across countries and companies, and provide actionable recommendations to improve sales and commission strategies.

### Data Source

The Pharmaceutical sales data for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle for selected countries and companies in 2015.

### Tool

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

1.	The data was loaded in Excel
2.	I checked for missing values, and duplicates.
3.	Ensured the consistency of date format, and also verified the accuracy of numerical values by checking for outliers and inconsistencies.
4.	The data was then discovered to be clean, void of errors and missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1.	What is the overall sales trend?
2.	Which countries and companies were top sellers?
3.	What are the peak sales periods?

### Key Insights

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Sales by country: The sales in different countries evolved throughout the year. Thailand and India recorded the biggest sales. Countries such as Japan and the Netherlands also did well in sales. Meanwhile, Canada and Turkey had the lowest sales for the year. 
According to research, government and private healthcare spending in each country varies depending on economic situations. Again, weather conditions vary among countries, and harsh weather can affect the spread of certain diseases, altering consumer behaviour. 
- Sales performance varies significantly between companies. Pfizer and Generic had the highest sales due to their global presence. Pfizer leads with 1495, while Generic has 759. GlaxoSmithKline had the lowest sales in exactly one country. 
- Agent commissions were strongly correlated with total monthly sales across countries and companies. As product sales increase, so do the commissions paid to agents. Pfizer representatives earned higher commissions than others. 

### Recommendations

Based on the findings and insights from the data analysis, the following recommendations were made: 
1. Top-selling companies could broaden their geographical reach to meet high demand and maximise profits while providing additional resources to help underperforming companies increase their market share and profitability. 
2. Monitoring disease prevalence across countries to coordinate sales and marketing efforts. 
3. Implementing performance-based incentive programs to recognise outstanding agents in high-performing countries and companies. Agents in underperforming countries and companies should also receive special training to boost their sales capabilities.

### Future Work

A customer satisfaction survey should be conducted to determine the reasons for the high and poor sales in various countries and companies. The gathered data can be analysed further to provide insights into the likely core reason of low sales in specific countries, as well as companies' efforts to increase customer satisfaction. 

### Conclusion

This analysis provides useful insights and recommendations about XYZ Pharmaceutical's sales performance. Companies can improve their sales strategy and profitability through implementing the recommendations.
